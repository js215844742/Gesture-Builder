# Gesture-Builder

In my experience, working with default Gesture Builder from Android is serious pain.
So, I wrote this application that helps you create, save, test and share hand-drawn gestures.
App link : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pack.GestureApp

I use IntelliJ IDEA.

PS: If you like the app, give it 5-star rating!

***<Update>***

This is an old project and need update.
In particular, it does not use Gradle build. If you are interested, create a pull request.
